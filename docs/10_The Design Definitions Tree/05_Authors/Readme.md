# Authors

Authors are a special kind of meta data, because DSK offers name resolution: Each design aspect may be authored by one or multiple humans. To assign yourself, use the `authors` key in the `meta.yaml` [configuration file](/The-Design-Definitions-Tree/Meta-Data).

To enable automatic full names for each author, create a file called `AUTHORS.txt`  inside the root of the [DDT](/The-Design-Definitions-Tree). Each line of the file lists an author’s full name and her/his email address in angle brackets.

```
Christoph Labacher <christoph@atelierdisko.de>
Marius Wilms <marius@atelierdisko.de>
```

When the author information of an aspect contains an email address assigned to a person in this file, DSK will display the authors’ full names and link to their email addresses.
