# Aspects

An aspect documents a specific part of your Design System. This might be an actual component, when you are documenting the user interface, or a chapter of your company’s guide into its design culture – this very page is actually an aspect in the DSK documentation structure.

You set up an aspect by creating a new directory in your design definitions tree and filling it with content: The directory may hold several files to document this design aspects, like [documents](/The-Design-Definitions-Tree/Documents), [assets](/The-Design-Definitions-Tree/Assets) and a [configuration file to add meta data](/The-Design-Definitions-Tree/Meta-Data). The name of the directory is considered to be the title of the aspect.
