# Assets

You can add files of any filetype to an aspect in DSK – just place them in the folder. These files are treated as assets, and are displayed for download in the “Assets”-tab of the aspect (check out the [“Assets”-tab on this page](?t=assets)!). You can also link to those assets in your [documents](/The-Design-Definitions-Tree/Documents), and embed some, like images and videos.

## Embedding images and videos in documents

To use an image in a document, place it in the folder of the aspect (making it an asset of this aspect). You can then embed the image using the regular [Markdown image syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/):

```
![alt-text](asset.jpg)
```

To use an video in a document, place it in the folder of the aspect (making it an asset of this aspect). You can then embed the image using the HTML-sytax (you can use the same syntax in Markdown documents as well!)

```
<video src="my-video.mp4"></video>
```
