# Meta Data

You can add meta data about an aspect by placing  a special file called `meta.yaml` into the directory of the aspect. This file holds meta data, like a short description, tags and authors, about an aspect. The file uses the easy to write  [YAML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3tQPk8DNbk)  format.

```Component
<Banner title="Note" type="important">If you prefer to use  <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a> as a format, that is supported too. Just exchange <code>.yaml</code> for <code>.json</code> as the extension.</Banner>
```

An example of a full meta data file looks like this:

```Component
<CodeBlock title="meta.yaml">
authors: 
  - christoph@atelierdisko.de
  - marius@atelierdisko.de

description: > 
  This is a very very very fancy component. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
  sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore
  magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua.

Possible meta data keys are:
* `authors`: An array of email addresses of the document authors. See _Authors_ for more information.
* `description`: A single sentence that roughly describes the design aspect.
* `related`: An array of related aspect URLs within DSK.
* `tags`: An array of tags to group related aspects together.
* `version`: A freeform version string.

You can also add custom meta data, under the key `custom`. These items will be displayed alongside the general meta data of the aspect.
