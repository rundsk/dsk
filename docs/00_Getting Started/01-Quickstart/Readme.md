# Quickstart

1. Visit the  [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/atelierdisko/dsk/releases)  and download one of the quickstart packages for your operating system. For macOS use `dsk-darwin-amd64.zip`, for Linux use `dsk-linux-amd64.tar.gz`.
2. The package is an archive that contains the DSK executable and an example design system. Double click on the downloaded file to unarchive both.
3. You start DSK by double clicking on the executable. On first use please follow  [these instructions](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25088)  for macOS to skip the developer warning.
4. You should now see DSK starting in a small terminal window,  [open the web application in your browser](http://localhost:8080/), to browse through the design system.
