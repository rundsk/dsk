# Getting Started

## Special files: componentdemo.md
If you place a file called `componentdemo.md` amongst your [documents](/The-Design-Definitions-Tree/Documents) for an [aspect](/The-Design-Definitions-Tree/Aspects) in the [design definitions tree](/The-Design-Definitions-Tree), its contents will be displayed in a large [Component Demo](/The-Frontend/Documentation-Components/Component-Demo) on the top of the aspect’s page in DSK. This is helpful to display a general demo of the aspect, so your users can immediately see what the aspect is about. You can see an example of this in the documentation for some of the frontend’s special components, e.g. the [Banner](/The-Frontend/Documentation-Components/Banner).
