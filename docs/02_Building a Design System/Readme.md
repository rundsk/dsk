## Shameless self-plug

DSK is designed and developed by [Atelier Disko](https://atelierdisko.de), a
German design and software studio based in Hamburg and Berlin, with experience in building
and maintaining Design Systems. 

Don’t worry, you can use DSK on your own, but if you would like some
help with creating a Design System for your organization, [write us a
mail](info@atelierdikso.de)!
