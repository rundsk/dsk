# process (although this one may work for you, as it's pretty standard), you'll
# need to create a new Dockerfile basing it off this one.

# feature is of any use in secenarios we imagine the docker
# container is being run. Alternatively the tutorial at
# http://kefblog.com/2017-07-04/Golang-ang-docker can be used to enable CGO
